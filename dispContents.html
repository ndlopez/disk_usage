In modern browsers, Files have Blob properties and functions. These functions allows us to read the file.

   .text() transforms the file into a stream and then into a string.
   .stream() returns a ReadableStream.
   .arrayBuffer() returns an ArrayBuffer that contains the blobâ€™s data in binary form.
   .slice() allows you to get slices of the file.
